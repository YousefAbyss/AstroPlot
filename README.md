## Note:
You'll need to install scienceplots (https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots)

The data has been reduced in size, extract data.rar and change the path in the notebooks. Download link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkTblTtCg91KrqRTEU13K0RRVKG5it1h/view?usp=sharing

Notebooks should be easy to read and self-explanatory, feel free to contact me if you need help.
