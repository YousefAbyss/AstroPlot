## Note:
You'll need to install scienceplots (https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots)

Data used in the notebooks are not in this repository.

Notebooks should be easy to read and self-explanatory, feel free to contact me if you need help.

## Notebooks:
A1: Matplotlib only

A2: Matplotlib rcParams (https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html)

A3: SciencePlots only

A4: Matplotlib rcParams & SciencePlots

B123: Multiple data and plots using regex

C1: pcolormesh and colorbar (only the last part of the notebook is important)
